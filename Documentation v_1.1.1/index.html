<h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<hr />
<p>Additive manufacturing—commonly called 3D Printing—is an ideal solution for creating concept models, manufacturing tooling, functional prototypes, and even end-use parts in many cases. Online 3D printing services are used by design firms and part manufacturers for making prototypes and molds. 3D printers are sophisticated machines that use advanced technology adhering to very high-quality standards. </p>
<p>This high-quality standards needs to be reflected to your end customers from the start. The most important part of receiving a quote is let your customers to know below information when they first come to your web site.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the cost to print my STL File?</li>
<li>What are the printing technologies you are providing?</li>
<li>What are the material choices?</li>
<li>What are the provided resolutions and layer heights?</li>
<li>Do you provide finishing options for the end product?</li>
</ul>
<p>With 3DMetri your customers will get their answers by themselves. You will only work for the Orders not for the deals.

<h1 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h1>
<hr />
<p>The only Prerequisites for this code is a <strong>Hosting Service</strong>. It must be <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong>.. Also, you need to have a <strong>Stripe</strong> account and be ready to obtain Stripe Secret key. </p>
<h3 id="what-is-amazon-web-services-aws">What is Amazon Web Services (AWS) ?</h3>
<p>AWS, Inc. is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered pay-as-you-go basis. These cloud computing web services provide distributed computing processing capacity and software tools via AWS server farms.</p>
<p>Please open up an account at AWS. https://aws.amazon.com/</p>
<p>We will use below services for our Web App:</p>
<p><strong>- Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)</strong></p>
<p>S3 is a service offered by Amazon Web Services that provides object storage through a web service interface. </p>
<p><strong>- Amazon Serverless Computing (LAMBDA)</strong></p>
<p>AWS Lambda is an event-driven, serverless computing platform provided by Amazon as a part of Amazon Web Services. It is a computing service that runs code in response to events and automatically manages the computing resources required by that code. </p>
<p><strong>- Amazon Simple Email Service (SES)</strong></p>
<p>Amazon SES is a cloud email service provider that can integrate into any application for bulk email sending. </p>
<p>Please do not afraid. This will be a one click installation with AWS CloudFormation template. AWS CloudFormation is an infrastructure as code (IaC) service that allows you to easily model, provision, and manage AWS and third-party resources. You will receive a CloudFormation Template File with the source code and you will use it to provision all the necessary resources. Please go on the installation part of this document.

<p>You will see that Verification is pending on the next screen. You will receive an email from amazon to verify the email address you entered. Open the email and click the link to verify your email address.</p>
<p><strong>Step-4</strong></p>
<p>We are almost done.  We will write down to function addresses on the index.html page.</p>
<p>These are AWS Lambda function addresses. Go to the search bar, write Lambda, and click on the Lambda Service. </p>
<p>You will see three functions testGetSignedURL, testsendSESEmail and createStripePaymentLink. </p>
<p>Test is the prefix it can be something else in your situation. Click on the GetSignedURL function. </p>
<p>You will see the Function URL on the right-hand side. It is a link address. </p>
<p>Copy it and open index.html in the SourceFiles/3DMetri/dist
you will see three config options VUE_APP_BASE_SES_LAMBDA_URL, VUE_APP_BASE_GET_SIGNED_URL and VUE_APP_BASE_CREATE_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK_URL under window.Metri_Config option.</p>
<p>Set these parameters with the appropriate function url address. They may look like this:</p>
<p>VUE_APP_BASE_SES_LAMBDA_URL:'https://fpzm4mm4h5ztklv4sozdesk2vbm0nbswd.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/',</p>
<p>VUE_APP_BASE_GET_SIGNED_URL:'https://l3oa4mtr6eerb2f7sdvkflwzfl40kdlho.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/',</p>
<p>VUE_APP_BASE_CREATE_STRIPE_PAYMENT_LINK_URL:'https://l3oa4mtrpzm4mm4h5ztflwzfl40kdlho.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/'</p>
<p>Set VUE_APP_BASE_SES_LAMBDA_URL to testsendSESEmail function url address, </p>
<p>Set VUE_APP_BASE_GET_SIGNED_URL to testGetSignedURL function url address and </p>
<p>VUE_APP_BASE_SES_LAMBDA_URL to createStripePaymentLink function url address.</p>
<p>With this, the front-end will know the address of the functions that it needs. Save the index.hml file.</p>
<p><strong>Step-5</strong></p>
<p>In this final step go to S3 Service by writing S3 to the search bar and click it. </p>
<p>You will see your buckets. Click test-3dmetri bucket. </p>
<p>If you write an other prefix your bucket name will look like prefix-3dmetri Click and enter inside the bucket.</p>
<p>Upload all the files in the SourceFiles/3DMetri/dist directory to this bucket. </p>
<p>Select all the files in the directory and drug and drop to on the browser. </p>
<p>Or you can click the upload button and then select all the files. </p>
<p>This bucket will be your web site address. To find out the web address for this setup click the properties tab of this bucket and scroll down to the page. You will find a web link at the end in the Static website hosting section. </p>
<p>You can assign a custom domain to this link.
